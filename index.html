      <h1>Mary's Grandbaby (something like a goodbye for my grandmother)</h1>
      <h2>By Carissa Fleury</h2>

    <div class="poem">
      <div class="column">
        <p>my nana is<br>backyard peach trees<br>dripping in california sunshine but<br>her heart was always in<br>nashville</p>
        <p>when she was forced from that home <br>because of fear of strange fruit<br>&amp; trees &amp; picnic postcards, she<br> breathed a sigh into a bottle and<br> buried it in the hot tennessee soil</p>
        <p>my nana just gave her last sigh and <br>all I can think of is<br>charcoal women and how<br>she couldn’t remember me but <br>when she lay dying<br>my auntie told me across miles of land,<br>over crackling telephone lines and in cracking voices <br>that my nana’s eyelids fluttered when<br>she heard my voice</p>
        <p>when I was a Black baby <br>(born with dusty dark skin <br>that lightened over the<br>years and a full head of hair) <br>she pressed her grammy kisses <br>into my cheeks and called<br>me “little peach” for the first time</p>
        <p>as I grew up, I got gangly,<br>then<br>melancholy and every summer I<br>ran around picking peaches off of her <br>trees as she played jazz on the radio and told me that<br>my laugh sounded like a<br>miracle, taught me to<br>love the color yellow and long for her <br>Black fingers oiling my scalp when<br>I left at the end of each summer</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>my nana was the first one<br>who showed me Billie Holiday<br>on her back porch with sticky<br>fingers from homemade<br>pies and as she lay dying, I sang<br>her Billie Holiday—<br>for years, I was dreading<br>this day becoming a marked-on-the-calendar day <br>this same day as her daughter’s birthday<br>she passed away and<br>my papa was an oak tree but<br>my nana was a warm breeze</p> 
        <p>my nana taught me that this Black<br>body is holy, wholly<br>she taught me to love each inch of my skin, <br>to oil it up<br>because nobody else would love it like I did <br>to braid my hair each night with my fingers <br>(the same as hers)<br>to stand with a straight spine (when I could) <br>to speak in a red brick voice and<br>to never let no white men tell<br>me I wasn’t worth nothin’<br>because I was Mary’s grandbaby and ain’t <br>nobody gon’ tell me I’m not worthy</p>
        <p>papa went first and now my nana, <br>my two Black strongholds<br>&amp; now they’re ghosts<br>or maybe spirits<br>or maybe they’re nowhere<br>or maybe they’re everywhere<br>and maybe this<br>black queer body of mine will<br>always tingle when I eat peaches or hear Billie</p>
        <p>and when I braid my Black girl <br>students’ hair and<br>my fingers twist as<br>second nature, and they ask me <br>where I learned this, I will say <br>with a warm breeze smile<br>“my nana taught me.”</p>

      <p>I’ve been gazing <i>hard</i> so my memory for it &emsp;&emsp;is better now than when I was a child, <br>
      but still I blink &emsp;&emsp;and everyone seems to be better than me at remembering I’m not<br> 
      White. I thought I managed to &emsp;&emsp;Be <i>assimilated</i>&emsp;&emsp; which means: (of information) <br>
      to take in</p>
      <p>and understand fully; or (of an organism) absorb and digest. <i>The organism<br>
      assimilates nutrients from outside its body to&emsp;&emsp; make structures needed</p>
      <p>inside of it to survive.</i> Would you believe me if I tell you, I am<br>
      the organism swallowing, &emsp;&emsp;I am full of American structures inside&emsp;&emsp; but I wasn’t <br>
      told they wouldn’t make my face any Whiter &emsp;&emsp;I’m the only one who knows they <br>
      are there &emsp;&emsp;even though I put them there</p>
      <p>for everyone White. To know me better &emsp;&emsp;friends ask questions (they’re the reason<br> I don’t know how to answer)</p>
      <p>David and I are becoming friends, we even get sort of drunk together some nights <br>walking fast stumbling</p>
      <p>on a dark street he says, I have been wondering, so your nose ring—is it ‘cause <br>
      you’re Indian? <i>I assimilate Whiteness</i> I thought I had learned to offer<br>
      answers (a blackberry gushing</p>
      <p>with sweet juice and ruined, pressed for a secret &emsp;&emsp;I want to have) so well I can’t <br>
      believe the first thing he sees. There have been no reasons to put up Indian <br>structures inside &emsp;&emsp;(I gave up the chance to have the secrets I want to have). Or <br>
      Look</p>
      <p>at my <i>dot thing</i>, announces the child I tutor in math. She can  nally add fractions <br>the best place to &emsp;&emsp;paste the Earned Gold Star</p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;is between her eyebrows. I tell her mother who says, Seems like a great teaching <br>
      moment! What <i>does</i> that Indian dot mean? She wants &emsp;&emsp;to learn too, reminds me<br>I am here to be an educator &emsp;&emsp;but I never learned about bindis never learned about <br>
      India &emsp;&emsp;didn’t lose that <i>part</i> I never had it I</p>
      <p>lost my chance at it.<br>Now I’ve been gazing hard</p>
      <p>Be <i>assimilated</i> &emsp;&emsp;(of information) to take in and understand fully &emsp;&emsp;I did only part- <br>
      one of that &emsp;&emsp;it was never meant for me to understand fully &emsp;&emsp;I’ll spend years <br>
      trying to come back to India &emsp;&emsp;a country I don’t remember leaving. &emsp;&emsp;You teach</p>
      <p>me <i>the organism</i> America &emsp;&emsp;never did<br>
      take me inside.</p>

    <p>sometimes I forget<br>about the blood<br>that lurks under the blue liquor of the harbor.</p>
    <p>if I wait long enough<br>I can hear the echoing sounds of machines, <br>of hands on tilling hoes,<br>of clicks on buttons,</p>
    <p>because all the hurt<br>on people’s hands<br>sheds a bit on everything they touch.</p>
    <p>I hear the hurt everywhere <br>it opens the world to me.</p>

        <p>i. it bothers me sometimes that there’s no place to go back to. bodies, tension, string. snap, snap,  ash, fuck, i never should have come here. you don’t know what it’s like to bathe in blood no one shares. to nurse my own diaspora. ma, forgive me for leaving you at home, my heart thinks of you and weeps, weeps, weeps. i am only a child, and i should have been a vessel. last week when i couldn’t sleep at night, sweat clouding my neck, i thought of you. you don’t know what it’s like to nurse my own diaspora. shoulder blades and dirty necks i had to nurse my own diaspora. i scrubbed the yellow out of my  ngernails. shoulder blades and dirty necks i had to nurse my own diaspora. ashed a cigarette on fresh snow and called it home.</p>
        <p>ii. it bothers me sometimes that there’s no place to go back to. horizons in limbo. she looks at me and holds my heart in her eyes and she looks so gentle i feel my heart slow and then weep. shoulder blades and dirty necks and an expired time sheet. god saw me turn orange and i knelt in front of her. i couldn’t tell if it was sandpaper or her tongue but i bled anyway. he plunged his fingers into me and i wondered why i even bothered. he plunged his fingers into me and i felt her hand brush against mine. it was an accident but she looked at me and my hair grew heavy, fuck, fuck, there’s no going back.</p>
