    <h1>Mary's Grandbaby (something like a goodbye for my grandmother)</h1>
    <h2>Carissa Fleury</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="column">
      <p>my nana is<br>backyard peach trees<br>dripping in california sunshine but<br>her heart was always in<br>nashville</p>
      <p>when she was forced from that home <br>because of fear of strange fruit<br>&amp; trees &amp; picnic postcards, she<br> breathed a sigh into a bottle and<br> buried it in the hot tennessee soil</p>
      <p>my nana just gave her last sigh and <br>all I can think of is<br>charcoal women and how<br>she couldn’t remember me but <br>when she lay dying<br>my auntie told me across miles of land,<br>over crackling telephone lines and in cracking voices <br>that my nana’s eyelids fluttered when<br>she heard my voice</p>
      <p>when I was a Black baby <br>(born with dusty dark skin <br>that lightened over the<br>years and a full head of hair) <br>she pressed her grammy kisses <br>into my cheeks and called<br>me “little peach” for the first time</p>
      <p>as I grew up, I got gangly,<br>then<br>melancholy and every summer I<br>ran around picking peaches off of her <br>trees as she played jazz on the radio and told me that<br>my laugh sounded like a<br>miracle, taught me to<br>love the color yellow and long for her <br>Black fingers oiling my scalp when<br>I left at the end of each summer</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>my nana was the first one<br>who showed me Billie Holiday<br>on her back porch with sticky<br>fingers from homemade<br>pies and as she lay dying, I sang<br>her Billie Holiday—<br>for years, I was dreading<br>this day becoming a marked-on-the-calendar day <br>this same day as her daughter’s birthday<br>she passed away and<br>my papa was an oak tree but<br>my nana was a warm breeze</p> 
      <p>my nana taught me that this Black<br>body is holy, wholly<br>she taught me to love each inch of my skin, <br>to oil it up<br>because nobody else would love it like I did <br>to braid my hair each night with my fingers <br>(the same as hers)<br>to stand with a straight spine (when I could) <br>to speak in a red brick voice and<br>to never let no white men tell<br>me I wasn’t worth nothin’<br>because I was Mary’s grandbaby and ain’t <br>nobody gon’ tell me I’m not worthy</p>
      <p>papa went first and now my nana, <br>my two Black strongholds<br>&amp; now they’re ghosts<br>or maybe spirits<br>or maybe they’re nowhere<br>or maybe they’re everywhere<br>and maybe this<br>black queer body of mine will<br>always tingle when I eat peaches or hear Billie</p>
      <p>and when I braid my Black girl <br>students’ hair and<br>my fingers twist as<br>second nature, and they ask me <br>where I learned this, I will say <br>with a warm breeze smile<br>“my nana taught me.”</p>
