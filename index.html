            <h1>A Slow Brunch</h1>
            <h2>By Katie Saviano</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My grandmother forgot my name when I saw her over winter break.</p>
            <p>She has been forgetting for years, a process which has dulled her. At brunch, I ask her questions about her life that I know she will not be able to answer.</p>
            <p>She sips her coffee slowly and compliments a meal that is objectively bad. The entire decade of the 80s appears to have vanished.</p>
            <p>In the fourth grade, I realized something was wrong when I was assigned a family tree project. My mom pursed her lips, a tightness forming, and sent me to school the next day with a white paper.</p>
            <p>This whiteness is my grandmother&rsquo;s memory. In my family, we call violence forgetfulness. We call it old age.</p>
            <p>My grandmother has forgotten. <br />But my mother remembers those years, and all the years that have followed. Sometimes she weeps openly at the kitchen table, late at night when she thinks we are asleep.</p>
            <p>In my family, we don&rsquo;t use words like traumatic brain injury from domestic violence. In my family, we cultivate silence, practice roundabout ways of speaking.</p>
            <p>My mother prefers to engage in conversation when we are in the car so that we never make direct eye contact.</p>
            <p>The truth is, in my family, we rename violence absence.</p>
            <p>My grandmother has become this forgetting. I have never known her when this trauma was not a part of her. At brunch, her eyes are vacant. I want to ask her: how do you claim a history that you do not remember?</p>
            <p>I want to ask her about the reverberations of this trauma, how its roots trace through our family tree, and why my aunt died slowly, and then all at once.</p>
            <p>Instead, I ask her about the eggs she ordered. It&rsquo;s okay that you don&rsquo;t remember my name, I tell her. I&rsquo;m Katie.</p>

      <h1>A Guide to Helping Depressed Parents</h1>
      <h2>By Michael Fogg</h2>
      <p>1. Count how many parents you have that are depressed. This number should be somewhere between zero and two, not including any additional step or foster parents/ guardians. If the number is greater than zero, continue with the rest of this poem.</p>
      <p>2. Try to determine which of your parents are depressed. Now, some have said to consult a psychiatrist, or a psychologist, or WebMD, but I usually just look for the 50 million excuses why someone can&rsquo;t get out of bed.</p>
      <p>3. Attempt to approach your parents and talk about depression. If you have one or more depressed parent, do not be alarmed, this may be difficult. Asking them if they have depression will ricochet like arrows on steel-plate armor, telling them will get you a broadsword through the stomach. You have to pick apart the cloud that 50 years of fear has put around them water molecule by water molecule, you have to hold their parental pride in your hands like your own child and nurse it back to health, you have to drive an SUV through the walls of the dark, heavy box they are trapped in.</p>
      <p>4. Ask them to get help. Ask them to put depression on their back like a cape and fly like the super hero you always knew they could be, ask them to accept society&rsquo;s view that they have done something to make them this sad, ask them to look at themselves in the mirror and believe they have failed you.</p>
      <p>5. When that conversation is over, walk out of the room. Keep your mind there but put your body elsewhere.</p>
      <p>6. Watch for signs in the followings days, weeks, months. Look for the appointments on the floral kitchen calendar, look for which hand is dragging them through this mud, look for the empty chair they leave when they go on their stress walks. Pray to god every night that you see these things, and if you don&rsquo;t, pray they haven&rsquo;t spiraled so far you can&rsquo;t catch them.</p>
      <p>7. Find ways to put in gentle reminders. Ask them how their bodies felt today when they moved through molasses, ask them what the name of their therapist is and how many kids or dogs or cats he/she has, ask them if that hopeful silver star is in the sky again.</p>
      <p>8. Be disappointed when they tell you it isn&rsquo;t. Make your room a bunker, and accept that this is not a battle but a war, and wars are won in trenches. Watch the pill-shaped bullets fly in and out for years, as they change from blue to green to white and back again. Cry with them, cry without them, cry for them and about them, look down the cliff and hope they still see the ladder up to where you are standing.</p>
      <p>9. Recognize they may not. Recognize that loving someone with depression is still not being someone with depression, and that you will never totally understand why they can&rsquo;t seem to dance today.</p>
      <p>10. Enjoy every moment you have with them, for the days full of freedom come in unexpected bursts. Eat french fries, walk your dogs together, laugh, love. Go on surprising road trips and bring home unexpected trinkets, write with them, make fun of them and hug them. Shake off whatever feels normal, and when it comes knocking, wait for one more moment before you open the door again.</p>
