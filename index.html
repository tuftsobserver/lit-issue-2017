            <h1>A Slow Brunch</h1>
            <h2>By Katie Saviano</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My grandmother forgot my name when I saw her over winter break.</p>
            <p>She has been forgetting for years, a process which has dulled her. At brunch, I ask her questions about her life that I know she will not be able to answer.</p>
            <p>She sips her coffee slowly and compliments a meal that is objectively bad. The entire decade of the 80s appears to have vanished.</p>
            <p>In the fourth grade, I realized something was wrong when I was assigned a family tree project. My mom pursed her lips, a tightness forming, and sent me to school the next day with a white paper.</p>
            <p>This whiteness is my grandmother&rsquo;s memory. In my family, we call violence forgetfulness. We call it old age.</p>
            <p>My grandmother has forgotten. <br />But my mother remembers those years, and all the years that have followed. Sometimes she weeps openly at the kitchen table, late at night when she thinks we are asleep.</p>
            <p>In my family, we don&rsquo;t use words like traumatic brain injury from domestic violence. In my family, we cultivate silence, practice roundabout ways of speaking.</p>
            <p>My mother prefers to engage in conversation when we are in the car so that we never make direct eye contact.</p>
            <p>The truth is, in my family, we rename violence absence.</p>
            <p>My grandmother has become this forgetting. I have never known her when this trauma was not a part of her. At brunch, her eyes are vacant. I want to ask her: how do you claim a history that you do not remember?</p>
            <p>I want to ask her about the reverberations of this trauma, how its roots trace through our family tree, and why my aunt died slowly, and then all at once.</p>
            <p>Instead, I ask her about the eggs she ordered. It&rsquo;s okay that you don&rsquo;t remember my name, I tell her. I&rsquo;m Katie.</p>
